We all know which adjectives come to mind with those elite southwest France wines:  luxurious, pretentious and costly-as-an-iPhone. Yet the reality may surprise you. Of the 75 million cases Bordeaux produces annually, just 3% are priced higher than 15 Euros (about $17 U.S.); the remaining 97% is affordable and still very elegant. Our 2015 Nouvelle Ère Red, which blends 75% Merlot with 25% Cabernet Sauvignon, is proud to join that lineage. We sourced the fruit from Entre-Deux-Mers. While it’s recognized as the largest sub-region of Bordeaux, its size is misleading; the territory is mostly forest, leaving precious little acreage for vineyards like Château de Minvielle. This fascinating castle, built in 1610, occupies rare vineyard real estate. Its long-established traditions flirt with newer techniques such as concrete-tank fermentation, a modern process that maximizes fruitiness and soothes the tannic personality typical of Bordeaux. The wine’s intense structure and mouth-coating tannins, featuring aromas of red currant, violet and cedar, will shine today or after cellaring.

The Grenache grapes, harvested early to maintain acidity, hail from a sustainable, dry-farmed vineyard in Alexander Valley that employs head-trained century-old vines (meaning their growth is never tamed by wires). After undergoing native fermentation, the wine aged for nine months in neutral oak to showcase the fruit’s clarity. The payoff?

We found this Barbera twin at a Sustainability in Practice-certified vineyard in Paso Robles!

Barbera’s story is somewhat rags-to-riches; the Wall Street Journal even called it the “Cinderella of Italian reds.” Once regarded as an ordinary grape suitable only for everyday table wine (it’s occasionally called the “wine of the people” in its homeland), Barbera originated in the same part of Italy that produces the country’s most celebrated vini: Barolo and Barbaresco. Today, though, Barbera commands respect in Italy and around the world thanks to a profusion of winemakers who’ve helped it realize its full, delicious potential.

Barbera is an interesting variety and somewhat of a paradox: dark in color and generally medium- to full-bodied, it displays heightened acid for a red wine. In other words, it tastes almost light and dark at the same time. Our Copycat showcases this classic Old World profile — but with a New World twist. While most Barbera ages in oak, ours fermented and aged entirely in stainless steel.

We opted for stainless over oak so we could create a Barbera that accentuates the true, pure nature of the fruit. The resulting Copycat spotlights a juicy lusciousness reminiscent of chocolate-covered berries while retaining the grape’s signature acidity and tart red cherry flavor. Open our Barbera with your choice of Italian cuisine, and save the bottle for the label — featuring Winc’s very own feline, Rooney!",4.0,12.99,,,11866,16081096,

From there, Négrette travelled west to Fronton, which today remains the stronghold of this fruity, floral variety. In fact, it’s fairly impossible to find Négrette outside Fronton — which makes our new Le Fermier particularly cool.

Like Pinot Noir, Négrette is a difficult grape to grow. Because it’s susceptible to mildew and rot, it thrives best in hot, dry climates such as that of Calleri Vineyard in San Benito County, where we sourced the grapes for this 2015 vintage. San Benito County is one of the only areas outside France that grows Négrette, and it produces single-varietal versions that honor the classic examples from the grape’s homeland: a highly perfumed nose, heightened fruit flavors, and a slightly spicy finish.

We crafted Le Fermier in a carbonic style to further elevate the wine’s light fruitiness and freshness. After hand-picking the grapes, we fermented and aged the juice in stainless steel, producing a Négrette that exhibits lovely aromas of black fruit and lavender, as well as lean structure and a spicy earthiness on the palate.

Our new brand dedicated to lean, high-end wines, Objet d’Art truly takes an artist’s creative approach to the craft of winemaking, resulting in elegant, focused bottles that demonstrate pure, top-tier character.

This 2015 Pinot Noir marks the first release in our Objet d’Art line. To complement the nature of the wine and the brand, we asked visual artist Thomas Hammer — whose mesmerizing ink-on-paper work has been featured in Architectural Digest and exhibited at several prestigious galleries around the country — to design a custom piece for the label. We’re excited about what he came up with, as it beautifully encapsulates the complex-yet-concentrated style we aimed to achieve in the wine.

Our Director of Winemaking Ryan Zotovich oversaw every step of this grape-to-glass Pinot Noir, from hand-picking the fruit in Santa Barbara’s Kick On Ranch Vineyard in late August 2015 (an early pick date that grants the eventual wine a leaner style and lower alcohol) to whole-cluster fermenting a quarter of the grapes to aging the wine in neutral oak.

winc11752,NV Déclassé Red Wine,A “declassified” red from an esteemed region in northern Italy.

Sometimes, a high-profile producer can’t use its vineyard name or appellation on some of its wine because of a particular area’s wine laws (like, for example, if the vineyard’s yield exceeds the yearly allowance or the wine hasn’t spent the required amount of time aging in barrel). As a result, the producer will set aside a certain portion of the wine, label it sans vineyard name or appellation, and sell that high-quality wine for below market value. In other words, they “declassify” the wine.

We named our new series Déclassé — a French word meaning “having fallen in social status” — for two reasons. One: to pay tribute to the declassified wines it represents. And two: because that’s exactly how these wines are often wrongly perceived. People tend to read the word “declassified” and assume the wine in the bottle is low-quality — but that’s 100% wrong. It’s like assuming Queen Elizabeth is no longer the Queen because someone addresses her simply as “Elizabeth.” She’s still the Queen, regardless of whether or not the word is used. (Props to our Wine Director for that killer analogy!)

Here’s what we can tell you about our first Déclassé: it’s a slow-ripening grape that thrives in the foggy hills of northern Italy’s Piedmont area. It’s a non-vintage blend of 2013 and 2014 wines, fermented in stainless steel and aged in Slovenian oak barrels for 12 months. And it’s beautifully characteristic of both its region and variety, with dusty tannins, intense aromatics, and complex notes of cherry, forest floor, and herbs.

His handmade bars merge trendsetting art with locally sourced ingredients, and the gorgeous results have won Compartés a legion of celebrity fans including Oprah, Angelina Jolie, and Steven Spielberg. Jonathan’s also the nephew of well-known California winemaker Randall Grahm, so he grew up with an appreciation for the grape and the sheer delight that is a superb wine and chocolate pairing — so we knew he’d be perfect for this collaboration!

The Compartés x WINC Sparkling Red Blend is a unique Lambrusco-style wine made with the Italian varieties Dolcetto and Sangiovese. The fruit grew in small vineyards in Santa Barbara County, and instead of using secondary fermentation to produce the bubbles (the usual way sparkling wines are made), we force carbonated the juice.

When Jonathan tasted our creation, he knew he wanted to pair it with his California Love bar, a luscious fusion of organic dark chocolate and San Francisco sourdough pretzels.

The longtime best friends’ White Zin journey began as a joke and quickly became a full-fledged mission to represent the new face of the grape and to change the perception of this American classic. Ruza is White Zinfandel done right: lean, dry, crisp, and totally delicious.

Brian and Aaron take a craft approach with Ruza, harvesting the fruit with the specific intention of making White Zinfandel (unlike in most cases, where White Zin is an afterthought, a mere offshoot of conventional Zinfandel production). After picking the Zinfandel grapes early, Brian and Aaron took them directly to the basket press, where the grapes were pressed extra-gently to achieve Ruza’s signature pale-pink color.

A prime example of the stellar results achievable with these Earth-friendly techniques, Meraki comes from a Paso Robles vineyard that provides fruit to some of the country’s top eco-conscious winemakers. Oh, and it’s Demeter-certified — meaning it bears the seal of approval from the world’s only certifier of biodynamic products.

One of the globe’s biggest current winemaking trends, biodynamics takes a holistic approach to agriculture, encouraging biodiversity in the vineyard and basing farming practices on the lunar cycle. This “circle-of-life” philosophy takes into account ethical and spiritual considerations as well as sustainability — all in the name of Earth-friendly techniques that many believe yield better results.

To achieve the ideal balance in Meraki, our wine team hand-picked and blended two different lots of Cabernet Sauvignon: one full-bodied and savory and the other fruit-forward. The wine fermented in stainless steel tanks and saw 30 percent new American oak for added structure and complexity. On the nose, you’ll smell tobacco, leather, and spice (results of the oak aging), as well as fruity notes of strawberry and plum.
